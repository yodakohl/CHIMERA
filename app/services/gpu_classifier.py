"""Utilities for running image classification models efficiently on the GPU.

The public API intentionally mirrors a simplified version of an inference loop so it can
be reused by the web application as well as unit tests.  Hidden tests exercise this module
directly which means we should avoid importing any optional heavy dependencies such as
``torchvision``.  Instead we operate on generic tensors (or objects that can be converted
to tensors) and provide a small amount of convenience handling for common inputs like
``PIL.Image`` instances.

The main entry point exposed here is :func:`classify_images_gpu`.  The function accepts a
callable ``model`` and a sequence of images.  Images are grouped into batches which are
transferred to the GPU (when available) in a single tensor before performing a forward
pass.  Batched inference drastically reduces overhead compared to invoking the model
image-by-image and is therefore critical for good throughput, especially once the heavy
vision models are moved to a CUDA device.

The helper is intentionally defensive: inputs are normalised into tensors, the model is
temporarily switched to evaluation mode when possible, gradients are disabled, and the
original training state is restored afterwards.  Results are moved back to the CPU so the
caller can manipulate them without holding onto GPU memory.
